## Simple Instruction:

1. Use notebook `1.Posters Scrapper.ipynb` to choose movies from dataset and scrap posters.
2. Preprocess images, choose deep neural model (use Fine Tuning or not), get features from posters (`2.Data Preparation.ipynb`).
3. Load prepared data, create Nearest Neighbours model and make recommendation for specified titles (`3.Prediction.ipynb`).

*Several sample movie recommendations have been included in the `Results` folder*
